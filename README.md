# DevOps22-Wordle

This is a word guessing game.

It has 3 modes:

First mode lets the player guess on a word the bot have randomized, the bot will then give the players clues based on correct letters.

Second mode lets the player type in a word and lets the bot guess which word it is. The player then gives clues based on correct letters.

Third mode lets the bots play against eachother.

Run main.py to start the game.
